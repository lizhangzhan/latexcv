# Latex CV
Tired of formatting your resume in Word? Feel free to use my latex template for your own purposes.

You will need to compile with xelatex. 
If you are tired of installing various packages install texlive-full with `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` for pain free compilation.

Feel free to modify my `.tex` file to create your own resume. Please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission.

Happy compiling!
